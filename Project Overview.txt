- Project Overview

  This project demonstrates the creation of a simple stopwatch using an Arduino Nano and a 0.96-inch OLED display. The stopwatch displays the elapsed time and can be reset by pressing a button connected to the Arduino.

- Hardware Requirements

1. Arduino Nano
2. 0.96-inch OLED display (I2C or SPI communication protocol)
3. Breadboard (optional, for prototyping)
4. Jumper wires
5. Pushbutton (for reset functionality)
6. 10kÎ© resistor (optional, for button debouncing)
7. Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (Optional Libraries)

The specific library you'll need depends on your OLED display's communication protocol. Here are common options:
1. Adafruit_SSD1306 library for I2C displays 
2. U8G2 library for various display types 

- Circuit Assembly

1. Power Supply:
   Connect the Arduino Nano's VIN pin to your laptop's USB port using a USB cable. Alternatively, you can use a regulated 5V power supply.
   Connect the OLED display's VCC pin to the Arduino's 5V pin.
2. Ground:
   Connect the Arduino's GND pin to the OLED display's GND pin.
3. Communication Protocol:
   I2C:
    Connect the OLED display's SDA pin to the Arduino's A4 (SDA) pin.
    Connect the OLED display's SCL pin to the Arduino's A5 (SCL) pin.
    SPI: (Consult your OLED display's datasheet for specific pin connections.)
